# zoo_animal_classification

Built multi-classification machine learning models. During the preprocessing, I used the oversampling tecnhique to increase the recall and f1 score of class 4, 3, and 5. From low recall and f1 score which was below 50, I increased it to 67 for all the classes.  

The data sheet is available on Kaggle.
