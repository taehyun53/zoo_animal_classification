# zoo_animal_classification

Made machine learning models with multi-classification algorithm. I used the oversampling tecnhique to increase the recall and f1 score of class 4, 3, and 5. From low recall and f1 score which was below 50, I increased it to 67 for all the classes.  

The data sheet is available on Kaggle.
